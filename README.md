# Python_DES_Decryptor
A simple python script for decrypting DES that has been generated by a .NET application

This came up in an engagement where a C# application contained a hard-coded key that was being used to store user credentials for remote access.  As a POC we reverse engineered the application to extract the key and IV used to store the passwords and created a simple Python script to decrypt these.

## Typical C# Code for Storing DES Encryption

```
namespace DESCrypto
{
    class Hello 
    {
        static void Main() 
        {
            String key = "s3cret12";
            String iv = "vector12";
            String plaintext = "encrypt me please!";
            DESCryptoServiceProvider dESCryptoServiceProvider = new DESCryptoServiceProvider();
            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            CryptoStream cryptoStream = new CryptoStream(memoryStream, dESCryptoServiceProvider.CreateEncryptor(key, iv), CryptoStreamMode.Write);
            StreamWriter streamWriter = new StreamWriter(cryptoStream);
            streamWriter.Write(originalString);
            streamWriter.Flush();
            cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock();
            streamWriter.Flush();
            Console.WriteLine(" Convert.ToBase64String(memoryStream.GetBuffer(), 0, (int)memoryStream.Length);
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
